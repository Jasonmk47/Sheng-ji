# Sheng-ji
Online version of Sheng-Ji or 80 points


Very buggy currently

To test basic functionality users to make a game were hard coded and the game retrieved is always the first one
To see:
Make 4 users
Click create a game
Click start game

You should see your starting hand


Also note there is a bug that we cannot show pairs since the cards are the same. We should add an overall id to each individual card to stop this problem.
